# Rotating color wheel

This example works off the frameCount number. When the frameCount is divided by ten and the remainder is zero then the fill change will occur. When the frameCount is multiplied by 3, 5 and 7 and then divided by 255 to get colours. Then within the push and pop methods, the grid is translated to the center, then rotated by an angle which is generated by framecount divided and the remainder by 360. The rectangle is then drawn at this angle at 0,0 of the translated grid. 

``` js
function setup () {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  background(255);
  smooth();
  noStroke();
}

function draw() {
  //the framecount divided by ten, if its remainder is equal to zero then a fill occurs
  if (frameCount % 10 == 0) {
    //the fill is decided by the framecount multiplied by 3, 5 and 7 
    //which is then divided by 255 and then that remainder is used to decide colours
    fill(frameCount * 3 % 255, frameCount * 5 % 255,
      frameCount * 7 % 255);
    push();
      //translate to the center
      translate(100, 100);
      //rotate grid 
      rotate(radians(frameCount * 2  % 360));
      //draw rectangle at this new origin
      rect(0, 0, 80, 20);
    pop();
  }
}
```
