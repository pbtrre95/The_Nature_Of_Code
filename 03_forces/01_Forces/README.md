# Forces

Force can mean a variety of things. The definition of force that we care about comes from Isaac Newton.

```
A force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate.
```

## Newtons Laws

First Law:
```
An object at rest stays at rest and an object at motion stays in motion.
```

If no forces are placed upon an object with mass it will stay that way, and like that if an object has only one force placed on it eg. to move in one direction at one mile per hour with no gravity, wind etc. like in space, it will continue this way forever.

When forces cancel each other out, this is known as equilibrium.

So, an object's velocity vector will remain constant if i is in a state of equilibrium.

Second Law:
```
Force equals mass times acceleration.
```
Acceleration is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass. This means that if you get pushed, the harder you are pushed, the faster you'll move (accelerate). The bigger you are, the slower you'll move.

Third Law:
```
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
```
If you place a force on an object of mass, the force will occur in the same direction * -1, or opposite direction.
